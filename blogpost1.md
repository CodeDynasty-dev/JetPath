# Introducing JetPath: A Fast and Minimalist Framework for Node, Deno, and Bun.js

## it's Evening time here tho.

It's a evening over here, and i'm writing this article to share with the awareness about two thing.

1. The heavy and cumbersome nature of server-sider frameworks for NodeJs, Denojs and Bunjs
2. The solution y'all been waiting for!

Sit properly let's evaluate and hunt for something better. hhgs

## Cumbersome? what's cumbersome? teach your cat to fetch.

Things become cumbersome when they tends to create a dependency tree, complicated interfaces, poor innovation, high level of abstraction layers and most of all using solutions that implies runtime overhead.

I'm in the pothole with you if you onced feel your tools has these problems.

As a software engineer i always have this phylosophy of simplicity is easier to manage and extend. and that's what the tool i designed does, we will get into it in a moment.

### The bad offenders in most node Frameworks meow.

High learning curve, Abstraction layers, Convention over Configuration, Middleware management, boiler-platey codes, Configuration Overheads, Dependency Injection overhead, debugging challeges, updates and compartibility dramas.

Not make this article too long and creating a debate over the value of whatever advantages or disadvantages. i won't go much into detail on which tools is poor or what's not.

Let's talk about something better.

## Getting Started with JetPath

Using `JetPath` is incredibly straightforward, enabling you to create powerful applications with ease. Let's walk through a basic app setup to demonstrate the simplicity of JetPath:

```typescript
import `JetPath` from "jetpath";

const app = new JetPath({
  source: "./src", // Optional: Set the source folder for your routes
  port: 3000, // Optional: Specify the port you want to listen on
  cors: true, // Optional: Enable CORS support
});

// Start listening for requests
app.listen();
```

## Example Routes

To provide a better understanding of JetPath's capabilities, let's take a look at some example routes:

```js
// File: src/routes/cats.js

// GET localhost:8080/
export function GET_cats(ctx) {
  ctx.set("token", "0x00000");
  ctx.reply("Welcome home, `JetPath` fellas!");
}

// GET localhost:8080/cats
export function GET_cats(ctx) {
  ctx.reply({ foo: "bar" });
  // ctx.throw(400, "meow");
}

// POST localhost:8080/cats
export async function POST_cats(ctx) {
  console.log(await ctx.text());
  ctx.reply("Enter skelter");
}

// GET localhost:8080/cats/friday/12/male
export async function GET_cats$name$age$sex(ctx) {
  const { name, age, sex } = ctx.params;
  ctx.reply(
    `Hello ${name}, you are ${age} years old and you are ${sex}. Thanks for visiting the `JetPath` App!`
  );
}

// GET localhost:8080/cats?*
export async function GET_cats$$(ctx) {
  const { name, age, sex } = ctx.search;
  ctx.reply(
    `Hello ${name}, you are ${age} years old and you are ${sex}. Thanks for visiting the `JetPath` App!`
  );
}

// Hooks
export function hook__POST(ctx, data) {
  // console.log("POST boohoo");
  return data;
}

export function hook__PRE(ctx) {
  // console.log("PRE function boohoo");
  return data;
}

export function hook__ERROR(ctx, err) {
  ctx.throw(400, "Bad request!");
}
```

We define routes using function names, allowing for clear and concise code. `JetPath` also supports pre and post-request hooks, providing extra flexibility for customizations. Additionally, `JetPath` includes inbuilt CORS hooks, things everyone needs.

Some read-world codes (copied)

```js
export async function POST_admin_create_product(ctx: AppCTXType) {
  await productSchema.validateData(await ctx.json()).catch((e) => {
    ctx.throw(400, e); // code stopped executing here if erred
  }); // ignore it don't share my data validator library it's too fast.

  ctx.body.category = ctx.body.category.toLowerCase().trim();
  ctx.body.uploadedOn = new Date().toDateString();
  const product = new Product(ctx.body);
  const data = await product.save();
  ctx.reply({ data, status: 201, message: "ok" });
}

export async function Get_products_search$query(ctx: AppCTXType) {
  if (!ctx.params.query) return undefined;
  const search = await Product.find({
    title: { $regex: ctx.params.query, $options: "i" },
  })
    .limit(38)
    .exec();
  ctx.reply(search);
}
