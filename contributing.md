## Environment setup

To set up your environment, perform the following actions:

### Developer

1. Fork the Repository
Click the Fork button at the top right of the repository page to create a copy under your GitHub account. This allows you to freely make changes without affecting the original project.

2. Clone Your Fork Locally
Clone your forked repository to your computer using the command below. Replace <yourusername> with your GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/JetPath.git
```
3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project folder:

```bash
cd JetPath
```
4. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary packages with npm:

```bash
npm install

```
This will download and set up all libraries the project depends on.

5. Run the Development Server
Start the local server to preview your changes in real-time:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:4000).

6. Compile the Project
When youâ€™re ready to build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run compile
```
This compiles and optimizes the code for deployment.

> Additional Tips

* Create a new branch for your changes before you start working:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```
* Commit often with clear, descriptive messages.

* Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request to the main repository.

Feel free to ask questions or open an issue if you need help!
