# Introduction to Jetpath

**Write Once, Run Cross-runtime**

Welcome to Jetpath! ðŸš€ If you're a JavaScript/TypeScript developer looking to build modern APIs, you're in for a treat. Jetpath is more than just another framework - it's your new best friend in backend development, designed to make your life easier while giving you unprecedented flexibility.

## What Makes Jetpath Special?

Jetpath isn't just another framework - it's a new way of thinking about backend development. Here's why developers love it:

- **Write Once, Run Cross-runtime:** Your code runs seamlessly on Node.js, Deno, or Bun. No more worrying about runtime lock-in!
- **Zero-Config Magic:** Create endpoints by simply writing functions. No need to wrestle with complex configuration files.
- **TypeScript First:** Built with TypeScript from the ground up, giving you the best of both worlds: type safety and JavaScript flexibility.
- **Joy:** We've eliminated all the boring parts of backend development so you can focus on what matters - building amazing features.

## How It Works

Jetpath uses smart conventions and naming-based routing. Instead of writing route definitions, you just:

1\. Create `.jet.ts` or `.jet.js` files in your `src` directory

2\. Export functions with intuitive names like `METHOD_optionalPathSegment`

3\. Let Jetpath handle the rest

For example, create `src/users.jet.ts` with:
```typescript
// This becomes GET /users
export const GET_users: JetRoute = (ctx) => {
  ctx.send({ message: "I am super fast and runs on any runtime!" });
};
```

It's that simple!

## Why Developers Love Jetpath

Here's what makes Jetpath stand out:

- ðŸš€ **Blazing Fast Development:** No more configuration files or complex setup. Just write your code and let Jetpath handle the rest.
- ðŸ“š **Automatic API Docs:** Define your validation schemas once, and get beautiful, interactive API documentation that stays in sync with your code.
- ðŸ”’ **Type Safety:** Built with TypeScript first, giving you the best of both worlds: type safety and JavaScript flexibility.
- ðŸ§© **Unlimited Extensibility:** Extend Jetpath with official plugins or create your own. The framework is designed to grow with your needs.
- ðŸ’¡ **Smart Conventions:** Instead of fighting with the framework, Jetpath works the way you think. Function naming conventions means your code structure matches your API structure.

## Jetpath is perfect for:

- **Every Developer & Teams:** Build projects faster without sacrificing quality
- **Startups:** Rapidly iterate on your API while maintaining type safety
