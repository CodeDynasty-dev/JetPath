## Latest version info

In this version, we added/tested these features on all runtimes.

1. auto-generated api documentation UI (JethPath UI).
2. streaming via ctx.pipe(stream||filename).
3. file uploads [check this example](tests/uploading-files.md)
4. support for websockets [check this example](tests/websockets-usage.md).
5. Logger usage - (we tested pino/winston).

In this version (not this latest), multi-runtime support is no-longer based on compartiblity but pure engine api(s).

We Added Examples in the examples folder!

- running Node index.js starts a Node instance for your app.
- running Deno run index.ts starts a Deno instance for your app.
- running Bun index.ts starts a Bun instance for your app.
- looking into serverless

this version we fixed issues with the inbuilt cors hook.

- more speed, same size, more power.

# Rationale

JetPath is a web framework that is Granularity, Fast and Easy to use.

[benchmark repo](https://github.com/FridayCandour/jetpath-benchmark)

- JetPath now runs on the runtime you are using, bun or node or deno.
- Function names as routing patterns (newest innovation you haven't seen before).
- Pre, Post and Error request hooks.
- Inbuilt Cors handlers.
- Fast and small and easy as peasy.
- A strong backup community moved with passion for making the web better.
- Inbuilt API auto doc functionality.

JetPath is designed as a light, simple and but powerful, using the an intuitive route as function name system. you can be able to design and manage your api(s) with the smallest granularity possible.

This benefits are very lovely and delighting, but trust me you have never written javascript app in this manner before and you should definitely check this out.
