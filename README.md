## How JetPath works

JetPath works by search through the source forder and join up any defined paths and hooks that follows it's formart.

## Requirements to use JetPath.

JetPath support all server-side Javascrit runtimes:

- Nodejs.
- Denojs.
- Bunjs.
- Edge support for runtimes like cloudflare workers and deno deploy(in view).

## Installation

Install JetPath Right away on your project using npm or Javascript other package managers.

```
npm i jetpath --save
```

## Usage

JetPath is very simple, it allows you to create the most actions in app in a very intuitive way.

#### A Basic App setup

```ts
import JetPath from "jetpath";

const app = new JetPath({
  source: "./src", // optional
  port: 3000, // optional
  cors: true, // optional
});
//? listening for requests
await app.listen();
```

#### Example routes

```ts
import JetPath from "jetpath";

const app = new JetPath({
  source: "./src", // optional
  port: 3000, // optional
  cors: true, // optional
});

// in your ./src/dogs.js

//? GET locahost:8080/dogs
export function GET_dogs(ctx) {
  ctx.set("X-E", "boohoo");
  ctx.reply({ foo: "bar" });
  // ctx.throw(400, "boohoo you mf*");
}

//? POST locahost:8080/dogs
export async function POST_dogs(ctx) {
  console.log(await ctx.text());
  ctx.reply("enter skelter");
}

//? GET locahost:8080/dogs/friday/12/male
export async function GET_dogs$name$age$sex(ctx) {
  const { name, age, sex } = ctx.params;
  ctx.reply(
    "hello " +
      name +
      " you are " +
      age +
      " years old and you are " +
      sex +
      " thanks for visiting JetPath App!"
  );
}

//? GET locahost:8080/dogs?*
export async function GET_dogs$$(ctx) {
  const { name, age, sex } = ctx.search;
  ctx.reply(
    "hello " +
      name +
      " you are " +
      age +
      " years old and you are " +
      sex +
      " thanks for visiting JetPath App!"
  );
}

//? hooks
export function hook__POST(ctx, data) {
  // console.log("POST boohoo");
  return data;
}

export function hook__PRE(ctx) {
  // console.log("PRE function boohoo");
  return data;
}

export function hook__ERROR(ctx, err) {
  ctx.throw(400, "bad request!");
}
```

When improvements and changes rolls out, we will quickly update this page and the currently prepared [web documentation]("https://uiedbook.gitbook.io/jetpath/").

We intend to move with less traction and have implemented many of the best decisions and designs we can think-of/research right from the beginning.

The `JetPath` class accepts an object argument with the following options:
