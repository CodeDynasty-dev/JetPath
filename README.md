## Latest version info

In this version, multi-runtime support is no-longer based on compartiblity but pure engine api(s).

- runing Node index.js starts a Node instance for your app.
- runing Deno run index.ts starts a Deno instance for your app.
- runing Bun index.ts starts a Bun instance for your app.

- looking into serverless

this version we fixed issues with the inbuilt cors hook.

- more speed, same size, more power.

Why let's remove any overhead of compartibilty layers, run bare, more speed.

How are we able to achieve this without any configuration, sperate repo, or chnage in package size? the Overview method, find out from our our community, JetPath your next app right and enjoy this cool benefit!!!

# Rationale

JetPath is a Small(6kb) Server-side framework that is Fast and Easy to use.

[benchmark repo](https://github.com/FridayCandour/jetpath-benchmark)

- JetPath now runs one the runtime you are using, bun or node or deno.
- Function names as routing patterns (newest innovation you haven't seen before).
- Pre, Post and Error request hooks.
- Inbuilt Cors handlers.
- Fast and small and easy as peasy.
- A strong backup community moved with passion for making the web better.

In JetPath, unlike express, fastify or other Javascript base server-side framworks, JetPath is designed as a light, simple and but powerful, using the an intuitive route as function name system. you can be able to design and manage your api(s) with more granularity as an easy peasy grease.

This benefits are very lovely and delighting.

## How JetPath works

JetPath works by search through the source forder and join up any defined paths and hooks that follows it's formart.

## Requirements to use JetPath.

JetPath support all server-side Javascrit runtimes:

- Nodejs.
- Denojs.
- Bunjs.
- and deno deploy (testing)
- Edge support for runtimes like cloudflare workers(in view).

## Installation

Install JetPath Right away on your project using npm or Javascript other package managers.

```
npm i jetpath --save
```

## Usage

JetPath is very simple, it allows you to create the most actions in app in a very intuitive way.

#### A Basic App setup

```ts
import JetPath from "jetpath";

const app = new JetPath({
  source: "./src", // optional
  port: 3000, // optional
  cors: true, // optional
});
//? listening for requests
app.listen();
```

#### Example routes

```ts
// in your src/app.js

import JetPath from "jetpath";

const app = new JetPath({
  source: "./routes", // optional
  port: 3000, // optional
  cors: true, // optional
});

//? listening for requests
app.listen();

// in your ./src/routes/dogs.js

//? GET locahost:8080/
export function GET_dogs(ctx) {
  ctx.set("X-E", "boohoo");
  ctx.reply("welcome home fellas");
}

//? GET locahost:8080/dogs
export function GET_dogs(ctx) {
  ctx.reply({ foo: "bar" });
  // ctx.throw(400, "poop");
}

//? POST locahost:8080/dogs
export async function POST_dogs(ctx) {
  console.log(await ctx.text());
  ctx.reply("enter skelter");
}

//? GET locahost:8080/dogs/friday/12/male
export async function GET_dogs$name$age$sex(ctx) {
  const { name, age, sex } = ctx.params;
  ctx.reply(
    "hello " +
      name +
      " you are " +
      age +
      " years old and you are " +
      sex +
      " thanks for visiting JetPath App!"
  );
}

//? GET locahost:8080/dogs?*
export async function GET_dogs$$(ctx) {
  const { name, age, sex } = ctx.search;
  ctx.reply(
    "hello " +
      name +
      " you are " +
      age +
      " years old and you are " +
      sex +
      " thanks for visiting JetPath App!"
  );
}

//? hooks
export function hook__POST(ctx, data) {
  // console.log("POST boohoo");
  return data;
}

export function hook__PRE(ctx) {
  // console.log("PRE function boohoo");
  return data;
}

export function hook__ERROR(ctx, err) {
  ctx.throw(400, "bad request!");
}
```

### ctx Overview at current

ctx is th JetPath parameter your route functions are called with.

```ts
export type AppCTXType = {
  // parse incoming data
  json(): Promise<Record<string, any>>;
  // readOnly(s)
  body: any; // only available after calling ctx.json()
  search: Record<string, string>;
  params: Record<string, string>;
  request: IncomingMessage; // original reg object
  method: string;
  // get and set headers and code
  get(field: string): string | undefined;
  set(field: string, value: string): void;
  code: number;
  //Reply  methods
  reply(data: unknown, ContentType?: string): void;
  throw(code?: number | string, message?: string): void;
  redirect(url: string): void;
};
```

When improvements and changes rolls out, we will quickly update this page and the currently prepared [web documentation]("https://uiedbook.gitbook.io/jetpath/").

We intend to move with less traction and have implemented many of the best decisions and designs we can think-of/research right from the start1.
